# Goofy Weather App

This is a simple Web app which pulls data from the [DarkSky API](https://darksky.net/dev) to aquire data, some values are also displayed in a linear chart using [Chartjs](https://www.chartjs.org/). I made this app to improve on my JavaScript skills, so I you have any recommendations feel free to submit any changes. I originally followed this [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPElVpR1rwA), so please give credits to the original author.
Here are some topics which you can learn if you follow the youtube tutorial or study this code.
  - Arrow Functions.
  - DOM manipulation.
  - Pull data from an API.
  - Use ChartJS to display dynamic data.
